# Maven launch
maven.launch.run=Runs the AndroMDA processor with AndroMDA plugins (i.e. \
cartridges and translation-libraries) found on your CLASSPATH. \
AndroMDA is configured through the value of the the maven.andromda.configuration.uri\
 property.
maven.launch.schema2xmi=Runs AndroMDA's Schema2XMI to provide XMI generation from a \
database schema. See Plugin Settings for more information on how to configure this \
goal.
maven.launch.start-server=Starts the AndroMDA server instance. When this is running,\
 modeling processing will occur on the server. This dramatically helps to improve \
 initialization and loading time when running AndroMDA because these things are \
 taken care of in advance (before the model is actually processed). The server is \
 configured through AndroMDA configuration file.
maven.launch.stop-server=Stops the AndroMDA server instance (if it's currently \
running). The server information is configured through AndroMDA configuration file.
maven.launch.install=Builds all components, an .ear bundle can be found in /app/target
maven.launch.mda-spring-java=Runs AndroMDA, only using the spring and java cartridges, in that order
maven.launch.core=Builds the core component, usually hibernate,ejb or spring
maven.launch.web=Builds the web component
maven.launch.core-web=Builds the core and web components, in that order
maven.launch.mda=Runs AndroMDA on the UML model
maven.launch.mda-core-deploy=Regenerates the spring code, rebuilds the core component, bundles the .ear and deploys
maven.launch.freegoal=Launch Maven with an arbitrary command line
maven.launch=Launch Maven
